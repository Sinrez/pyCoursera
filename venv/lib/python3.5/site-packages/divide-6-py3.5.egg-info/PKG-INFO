        Changelog
        =========
        
        2:
         - Added return option on auto_scroll section, used to scroll in backwards when
           end of page is reached. Correct value is boolean (true or false).
         - Added pause option on auto_scroll section, used to make a pause when end (or
           start) of page is reached. Correct value is integer, corresponding to the
           number of "milli" value to wait (eg: milli is set to 2, pause is set to 1000,
           auto_scroll will wait 2*1000 millisecond).
         - Changed application title (from old name).
         - To note: Divide has been used for more than a one month at Smartjog without 
           any problem, consequently, it developpement status is now "Stable".
